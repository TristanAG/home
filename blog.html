        <p><b>2016 recap</b> 12 / 17 / 2016</p>

        <p>
          My life wasn't going so well this time last year.
          In 2014 I was feeling on track to reaching my goal of working as a full time web developer.
          Having got my foot in the door with a QA position at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, my goal felt within reach.
          Everything was going great at first, but by the time I got the promotion I was after, my life
          had taken a considerable turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within a few months of working my new job, my kidneys stopped functioning, and I
          was barely getting by trying to live on dialysis. I wasn’t doing well at all.
          After about 6 months full time as an associate web developer, I had to
          essentially resign and go on full time disability. I spent the better part of
          2015 that way - extremely sick, unsure of the future, and not really knowing
          what to think or do.
        </p>

        <p>
          It wasn't all bad though. Something kind of interesting and unexpected happened to me during that
          time. I started building things for myself again, which felt amazing. First I started with games, doing
          everything from code, to pixel art, to animation. I played around with
          Unity and PhaserJS, and just had a blast creating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually my interests shifted back to web development. I started to get back into
          Javascript, and eventually Ruby on Rails, which I had wanted to gain a better understanding of
          since my co-worker at the aquarium first turned me on to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A point came where I was so sick that I really only had about 3-5 hours
          every morning where I felt ‘good’ enough to do anything. During that time my main goal would
          be to just write code - follow tutorials, build things, whatever it takes. It was kind of all
          I had. I felt awful, and most days pretty much sucked. I felt so reclusive and depressed dealing
          with what I was going through, I had to find some way to keep myself engaged and looking forward to something.
        </p>
        <p>
          I reasoned that
          if I could devote myself to writing code and growing as a programmer,
          my day would not be a total waste. Even as everything in my life felt like it was moving to the point of no return
          I had this one thing I could control. I could still get better at programming. I could still
          create things. It became my obsession, my passion… a reason to get out of bed in the morning.
        </p>
        <p>
          I recieved a kidney transplant from my sister in January 2016. Leading up
          to that, we started a project of building a website
          for her to ultimately sell her artwork. Also around the
          time of my surgery, a friend of mine was launching a new business, and
          she asked if I could build their website. I took her up on it, because
          the prospect of just creating something that somebody could actually use was exactly what I need while I recovered
          from my surgery.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was working freelance now. Still living on disability as I recovered from
          surgery, I felt pretty fantastic working on a few web projects and continuing to grow my skills.
          I picked up a few more clients during the next few months, and started to narrow down what it was that
          I wanted to do with web development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I first realized that design is not for me. I have been doing just about everything for my freelance projects, which was somewhat
          out of necessity. I began to realize that I really just want to write code, be it front end or back end.
          While not super pround of my designs, my clients were all very happy with what I had provided,
          and that felt ok for the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the last few months, my clients now wanted to make new sites, and improve on their old ones. They wanted custom functionality and ease of use. I, feeling so much better, healtheir, and more confident in my abilities, chose to finally put my Ruby on Rails tinkering to the test. My first client rails site is up and running as of this month, and my second one is coming along very nicely, and should be done pretty soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          I feel like I’m ending 2016 with a high note. I’m working part time as a freelance developer, and part time at a local store to make ends meet. I’m excited for 2017 to continue building my skills as a programmer and web developer, and I’m aiming to get a full time job in web development. My wife and I are thinking about relocating next year, and that may be determined by where I get a job.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either way, I’m very excited to pick up where I left off. My career was just starting to take off when sickness forced me out of work and nearly destroyed me. I’ve had a lot of time to rest, write code, build real apps for actual clients, and begin to reconnect with who I am as a creative person. I feel more in touch with my intentions and motivations, and I’m excited to make 2017 a truly remarkable year for my life and career!

        <p><b>Post meetup excursion</b> 11 / 17 / 2016</p>
        <p>
          I had a great time in san francisco attending a few meetups and visiting my friend Josh. The first meetup I went to was in the evening
          and it was about React Native. The talks were both very cool, and I really enjoyed meeting and talking to people.
          I'm excited to build some more interesting projects with React in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in SF I attended a meetup at <a href="https://labzero.com/">Lab Zero</a> that introduced the basics of Elixir.
          It was very cool, and the presenters both did an awesome job, even though I will admit that some of the content was a bit
          over my head. I feel like it has a lot more to do with my inexperience in functional languages then the content of the talk,
          because I did learn a lot, and it for sure got me intrigued with Elixer. I have to say, I love its Ruby-like syntax!
        </p>
        <p>
          During the talk a couple people heckled out "cause you're sipping the kool-aid!" and at one point, "objects are dead!" It was all fun, but it gave me the impression that
          Elixir is somewhat controversial in comparison to OOP languages like Ruby or C#. But I expected that, as that's been the vibe
          I've been feeling online from people. Overall I had a great experience because it got me excited to learn more about
          Elixir and functional programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          My friend who I was staying with, Josh, is an engineer at Uber, and he was nice enough to give me a tour of the downtown office where he works.
          I got to meet a few people, and everyone that I had a chance to talk to for a bit were really nice. I had never been inside any large tech company,
          and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. I was pleasently surprised by the vibe I got of the office. While the office did feel somewhat busy,
          it did not strike me as chaotic in any way. They layout of the space was beautifully put together and very pelasing to walk around in.
        </p>

        <p>
          All in all, visiting sf was great. I really want to be able to engage with more programmers IRL, but I'm not sure if san francisco is the right place for me.
          The energy feels very intense and fast paced in a way I can't really describe, but who knows.. maybe I could get in to it. All I know is that
          the next place I choose to live has to have a nice development / hobbyist scene, so I can get more involved!

        <p><b>Visiting SF</b> 11 / 16 / 2016</p>
        <p>
          I'm heading to San Francisco today to go to a couple meetups and stay the night with a friend who
          is a developer in the city. As much as I love Monterey, there is just no development community to speak of,
          and I think I need that now. I just gotta suck it up and make the 2-3 hour trek once or twice a month. Not a big deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been going at this alone for some time now, and although I love what I'm doing, I find myself feeling pretty
          isolated. It's frustrating because I really want to be involved, be it with a local community or with co-workers. I haven't felt like
          I've had that since I stopped working at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a lot of good things about SF (my family is originally from the bay area, so I've spent a good amount of
          time in the city, even though I grew up in Portland). But there's also some down sides to city life - expensive cost of living being one of the
          biggest issues. I guess I'm trying to say that I like SF a lot, but I'm not sure how well my wife and I would do living there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either way, I'm looking forward to spending more time in SF while we still live in Monterey.
          My wife and I are thinking about our next destination, having lived here for about 5 years now, and both of us coming to terms
          with what we want out of where we live. I'm focused on looking for jobs that would be a good fit for the environment and lifestyle
          that we're after, but I'm just not quite sure where that will be at this point.
